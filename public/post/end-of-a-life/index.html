          <h6 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Original song by Mori Calliope</h6>

          <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> ⭐</p>
          
          <p><strong>Chords:</strong> Cmaj7, D, Bm7, Em7</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>[Chorus]
</span><span>     Cmaj7
</span><span>We&#39;d run
</span><span>      D
</span><span>Right through
</span><span>      Bm7
</span><span>Those nights
</span><span>                               Em7
</span><span>I&#39;ll never find my way back to you
</span><span>inside this labyrinth of lights
</span><span>          Cmaj7
</span><span>There was madness
</span><span>In the meaning
</span><span>      D
</span><span>Never laughless
</span><span>                                    Bm7
</span><span>We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
</span><span>                Em7
</span><span>This city never died
</span><span>
</span><span>     Cmaj7
</span><span>I&#39;ll fly
</span><span>   D
</span><span>No proof
</span><span>      Bm7
</span><span>Those heights
</span><span>                                  Em7
</span><span>I&#39;ll never find another chance to say &quot;hey, thanks for saving my life&quot;
</span><span>      Cmaj7
</span><span>I was hopeless. It was stinging
</span><span>        D
</span><span>Running roadless
</span><span>                                  Bm7
</span><span>We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
</span><span>                Em7
</span><span>This city never died
</span><span>
</span><span>[Verse 1]
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>What was the root of it all?
</span><span>I couldn&#39;t say
</span><span>
</span><span>D
</span><span>Used to jump and then fall
</span><span>Rugged and clichéd
</span><span>
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Would shrug it off without complaint, not a sound
</span><span>
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>No use in trying to find friends, &#39;cause in the end nobody sticks around
</span><span>
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>It&#39;s when you shoved yourself into a crowded place
</span><span>
</span><span>D
</span><span>That you turned around and found yourself in love in outer space
</span><span>
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Cue the reckless nights, no strings
</span><span>Laughing at our own dreams
</span><span>
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Just what the hell was so funny?
</span><span>
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Bark up the wrong tree, stumble, used to falling great heights
</span><span>
</span><span>D
</span><span>Amidst a concrete jungle, singing &#39;cause it felt right
</span><span>
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>We mixed the ennui and troubles, rhyming our discontent
</span><span>
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>And though it&#39;s history, I can&#39;t forget the time that we spent
</span><span>
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Convinced that this could mean another end
</span><span>Exists between real and pretend
</span><span>
</span><span>D
</span><span>A twisted alter-fiction where I missed my chance, did not ascend, and
</span><span>
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Disappearing into the mist of &quot;never happened&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Is the me that I can never befriend
</span><span>I let it go
</span><span>
</span><span>[Pre-Chorus]
</span><span>Cmaj7         D
</span><span>Fade in, fade out
</span><span>           Bm7
</span><span>This crazy dream
</span><span>            Em7
</span><span>Without a direction, floating aimlessly
</span><span>Dmaj7           D
</span><span>There&#39;s nothing left
</span><span>           Bm7
</span><span>Back there for me
</span><span>                   Em7
</span><span>Breathe in, but it won&#39;t stop the rain from pouring
</span><span>
</span><span>[Chorus]
</span><span>     Cmaj7
</span><span>We&#39;d run
</span><span>      D
</span><span>Right through
</span><span>      Bm7
</span><span>Those nights
</span><span>                               Em7
</span><span>I&#39;ll never find my way back to you
</span><span>inside this labyrinth of lights
</span><span>          Cmaj7
</span><span>There was madness
</span><span>In the meaning
</span><span>      D
</span><span>Never laughless
</span><span>                                    Bm7
</span><span>We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
</span><span>                Em7
</span><span>This city never died
</span><span>But was there ever a soul inside?
</span><span>
</span><span>[Verse 2]
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Chasing fireflies between the soaring high-rises
</span><span>D
</span><span>Left a trail behind, defined it &quot;wasted time of our lives&quot;
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Silent singer, overworked and underpaid
</span><span>          Em7
</span><span>Thinks an office is a coffin until off is where you&#39;re laid
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Yet a thought persists, an optimist who ought to be afraid
</span><span>D
</span><span>Saw the &quot;nothing wrong&quot; in writing songs behind the lonely shade
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Is the world a sadder place without the words that you conveyed?
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>When the ladder fell and shattered every bar that we had played
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Does it matter in the end the sound diminished and decayed
</span><span>D
</span><span>And your friends grew tired of fantasy;
</span><span>you&#39;re wishing they had stayed?
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>You don&#39;t get to say &quot;I miss you&quot;
</span><span>You watched your heroes fade
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Into the rear-view mirror of the villain you portrayed
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Stop the pity party, listen you don&#39;t get to be dismayed
</span><span>D
</span><span>You don&#39;t get to be emotional, feel blessed you got it made
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>These the best of years of life because you chose to make a trade
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Recollect the days you hoped and you prayed for this
</span><span>What is there to miss?
</span><span>
</span><span>[Pre-Chorus]
</span><span>Cmaj7         D
</span><span>Fade in, fade out
</span><span>           Bm7
</span><span>This hazy dream
</span><span>            Em7
</span><span>Without a direction, floating aimlessly
</span><span>Cmaj7           D
</span><span>There&#39;s nothing left
</span><span>           Bm7
</span><span>Back there for me
</span><span>                 Em7
</span><span>Pretend it&#39;s the end of a made-up story
</span><span>
</span><span>[Chorus]
</span><span>     Cmaj7
</span><span>I&#39;ll fly
</span><span>   D
</span><span>No proof
</span><span>      Bm7
</span><span>Those heights
</span><span>                                  Em7
</span><span>I&#39;ll never find another chance to say
</span><span>&quot;hey, thanks for saving my life&quot;
</span><span>      Cmaj7
</span><span>I was hopeless. It was stinging
</span><span>        D
</span><span>Driving roadless
</span><span>                                  Bm7
</span><span>We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
</span><span>                Em7
</span><span>This city never died
</span><span>I&#39;ll say goodbye to the soul inside
</span><span>
</span><span>[Bridge]
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>And yet somehow
</span><span>There was romance
</span><span>
</span><span>D
</span><span>In our self-hate
</span><span>&quot;We&#39;ve got no chance&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>In this light maze
</span><span>But let&#39;s hold hands
</span><span>
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Through the night haze
</span><span>We&#39;ll run so fast
</span><span>
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>&#39;Til the school chime
</span><span>&#39;Til the train runs
</span><span>
</span><span>D
</span><span>We know it&#39;s time
</span><span>We&#39;re the sane ones
</span><span>
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Waking up now
</span><span>To the real life
</span><span>
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Let me daydream
</span><span>&#39;Til the next night
</span><span>
</span><span>Cmaj7             D
</span><span>I&#39;ll keep waiting
</span><span>                          Bm7 Em7
</span><span>I&#39;ll keep waiting for you
</span><span>
</span><span>Cmaj7 D Bm7 Em7
</span><span>[Music]
</span><span>
</span><span>[Outro]
</span><span>Cmaj7
</span><span>Waking up now, to my real life
</span><span>D
</span><span>Let me daydream, &#39;til the next flight
</span><span>Bm7
</span><span>Drowning so long, I got older
</span><span>Em7
</span><span>Now the crowd&#39;s gone, is it over?
</span><span>Is it over?

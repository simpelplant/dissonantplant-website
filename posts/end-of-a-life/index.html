<pre><code>[Chorus]
     Cmaj7
We'd run
      D
Right through
      Bm7
Those nights
                               Em7
I'll never find my way back to you
inside this labyrinth of lights
          Cmaj7
There was madness
In the meaning
      D
Never laughless
                                    Bm7
We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
                Em7
This city never died

     Cmaj7
I'll fly
   D
No proof
      Bm7
Those heights
                                  Em7
I'll never find another chance to say &quot;hey, thanks for saving my life&quot;
      Cmaj7
I was hopeless. It was stinging
        D
Running roadless
                                  Bm7
We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
                Em7
This city never died

[Verse 1]
Cmaj7
What was the root of it all?
I couldn't say

D
Used to jump and then fall
Rugged and clichéd

Bm7
Would shrug it off without complaint, not a sound

Em7
No use in trying to find friends, 'cause in the end nobody sticks around

Cmaj7
It's when you shoved yourself into a crowded place

D
That you turned around and found yourself in love in outer space

Bm7
Cue the reckless nights, no strings
Laughing at our own dreams

Em7
Just what the hell was so funny?

Cmaj7
Bark up the wrong tree, stumble, used to falling great heights

D
Amidst a concrete jungle, singing 'cause it felt right

Bm7
We mixed the ennui and troubles, rhyming our discontent

Em7
And though it's history, I can't forget the time that we spent

Cmaj7
Convinced that this could mean another end
Exists between real and pretend

D
A twisted alter-fiction where I missed my chance, did not ascend, and

Bm7
Disappearing into the mist of &quot;never happened&quot;

Em7
Is the me that I can never befriend
I let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cmaj7         D
Fade in, fade out
           Bm7
This crazy dream
            Em7
Without a direction, floating aimlessly
Dmaj7           D
There's nothing left
           Bm7
Back there for me
                   Em7
Breathe in, but it won't stop the rain from pouring

[Chorus]
     Cmaj7
We'd run
      D
Right through
      Bm7
Those nights
                               Em7
I'll never find my way back to you
inside this labyrinth of lights
          Cmaj7
There was madness
In the meaning
      D
Never laughless
                                    Bm7
We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
                Em7
This city never died
But was there ever a soul inside?

[Verse 2]
Cmaj7
Chasing fireflies between the soaring high-rises
D
Left a trail behind, defined it &quot;wasted time of our lives&quot;
Bm7
Silent singer, overworked and underpaid
          Em7
Thinks an office is a coffin until off is where you're laid
Cmaj7
Yet a thought persists, an optimist who ought to be afraid
D
Saw the &quot;nothing wrong&quot; in writing songs behind the lonely shade
Bm7
Is the world a sadder place without the words that you conveyed?
Em7
When the ladder fell and shattered every bar that we had played
Cmaj7
Does it matter in the end the sound diminished and decayed
D
And your friends grew tired of fantasy;
you're wishing they had stayed?
Bm7
You don't get to say &quot;I miss you&quot;
You watched your heroes fade
Em7
Into the rear-view mirror of the villain you portrayed
Cmaj7
Stop the pity party, listen you don't get to be dismayed
D
You don't get to be emotional, feel blessed you got it made
Bm7
These the best of years of life because you chose to make a trade
Em7
Recollect the days you hoped and you prayed for this
What is there to miss?

[Pre-Chorus]
Cmaj7         D
Fade in, fade out
           Bm7
This hazy dream
            Em7
Without a direction, floating aimlessly
Cmaj7           D
There's nothing left
           Bm7
Back there for me
                 Em7
Pretend it's the end of a made-up story

[Chorus]
     Cmaj7
I'll fly
   D
No proof
      Bm7
Those heights
                                  Em7
I'll never find another chance to say
&quot;hey, thanks for saving my life&quot;
      Cmaj7
I was hopeless. It was stinging
        D
Driving roadless
                                  Bm7
We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
                Em7
This city never died
I'll say goodbye to the soul inside

[Bridge]
Cmaj7
And yet somehow
There was romance

D
In our self-hate
&quot;We've got no chance&quot;

Bm7
In this light maze
But let's hold hands

Em7
Through the night haze
We'll run so fast

Cmaj7
'Til the school chime
'Til the train runs

D
We know it's time
We're the sane ones

Bm7
Waking up now
To the real life

Em7
Let me daydream
'Til the next night

Cmaj7             D
I'll keep waiting
                          Bm7 Em7
I'll keep waiting for you

Cmaj7 D Bm7 Em7
[Music]

[Outro]
Cmaj7
Waking up now, to my real life
D
Let me daydream, 'til the next flight
Bm7
Drowning so long, I got older
Em7
Now the crowd's gone, is it over?
Is it over?

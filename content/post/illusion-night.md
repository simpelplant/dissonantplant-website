[verse]
Em                                         
Kiss me! Keep those lips from wandering off
Em                                     
Tell me every sweet and tender thought!
Em                                    
Give me all you have to give and more…
Em              C           D    
Fantasy's where futures are born!

[Pre-chorus]
        C                  G                
Can you feel the beat? The rhythm, the tune…
     D         D#dim7     Em        G6
Your heart and mine - the countdown…  
       C              G            
If you feel something coming to you
  F#dim                   B    
Believe it and scream it aloud!

[Chorus]
                    Cmaj7      B              Em              G6  
I don't think "I'll miss you" anymore, like I did the day you left
        Am7     B7                     (Em7-D#m7-Dm7)
There's so many just like you, I could use instead!  
       Cmaj7      B                Em               G6 
'Cause passion burning bright only hurts you in the end
     Am7       B7          C    
This city will swallow the pain…
  Am7       B7       Em  
Tomorrow's another today…

Em                                   Fm   
Curtain Call's at dawn, darling! Showtime!
Em               (A - G6 - C - B)         
Spend our moment dancing in the moonlight!
Em                                       Fm 
'Till your gaze starts swaying with my body…
Em                   
Keep your eyes on me!

[Verse]
Em                                     
Take me somewhere, deep into the night…
Em                                        
Touch me - here, there, anywhere you like!
Em                                     
Trust me! Won't you let me look inside?
Em                            
Fantasies and futures collide…

     F               C                     D   B
It's just the two of us beneath the starry sky… 

[Chorus]
            Cmaj7       B             Em             G6      
If the only way to keep on living is "Keep on living strong!”
      Am7          B7                       (Em7-D#m7-Dm7)
Then, you can keep the kindness, 'cause I'm moving on!    
   Cmaj7        B                Em          G6   
No need to say "goodbye" to me - I'm already gone!
     Am7           B7     C  
Just wipe all your tears away
    Am7              B7       Em  
And know we'll start over someday…

Em                                Fm 
All your heart, your soul, your body…
Em                (C-Am-B) 
You belong to one and only!

Unconditionally yearning

Knowing no one else will do…

[Pre-chorus]
        C                G                  
Can you feel the bond between us grow tight?
      D      D#dim7     Em        G6  
We're closer than we've ever been!  
       C                G           
Follow me! Match your rhythm to mine

And let it all out from within!

[Chiorus]
                                                              
I don't think I miss you any more than I did the day you left…
Cmaj7        B             Em                     
I won't say "I love you” I know I'll take it back!
    Am7          B7                   (Em7-D#m7-Dm7)
I'm used to this I'm not the same old loser that    
       Cmaj7             B                Em               G6   
Burned bright and quick, when candles and wind could never last!
  Am7         B7        Em     D      
A city that's living in fast-forward's

    Cmaj7         B               Em           G6     
The perfect place for lovers like us to take a chance!
        Am7             B7                (Em7-D#m7-Dm7)
There's nothing here to stop us - when in Rome, romance!
     Cmaj7       B             Em             G6    
And, I won't let you leave me alone without a dance!
  Am7          B7         C   
I don't wanna' hear a goodbye…
      Am7         B7       Em    
Don't break the illusion tonight…

[Outro]
Em                                   Fm   
Curtain call's at dawn, darling! Showtime!
Em            (A - G6 - C - B)        
Spend forever living 'til the sunrise!
Em                                   Fm  
Feel that look, even with the lights off…
Em                  
Dance until we drop!

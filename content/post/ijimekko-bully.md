Intro

Am                              
She’s dressed up in diamond dust
F               
A lover of decay
G                           
Coated lashes, soul of ashes
C                    E
What more can I say?  

Am                 F              
Fumitsuketa ari no gyouretsu nante
  C    G#dim\D  G          C
Kizuitenai to daremo ga omou

Am
Loving you, killing you, isn’t it thrilling? 
You’ve said enough from those guts you’ve been spilling through
F
Crying and begging, a lovely sound
I tear at your soul, but ya still stick around.
Am
What I’ve found is a treasure indeed, a friend who can bend to my every need
F
I’ll use and abuse you and never feel bad until suddenly, funnily, you take my hand
Am
Tangle you tight in the yarns that I ‘ve spun and I’ ll
Do it again, to get what I want
F
Pretend that I ‘m harmless, I’ m actually alarmed this is something charming to anyone… (wow)
(Dm Em F)
The fact can actually make Death wanna Die?
I ‘m the one that you love, and I’ m making you cry
G
And it’s”just me”, after all.

Am
(whispers)

              F    
I’ll give you fire.
  G         C
Kokoro ni kau
    Am           F
Hello? garou garou
  G       C  Am
Unari kakeru   
F    G       C     Am         F   G       Am
Mata ijiwaru na tsume wo tatete katte ageru 

F    E   
Haze you.

         Am
When the curtains finally close and the show’s really over
       F
If you glance into my past, it’s just nothing new
G  
Lying, conniving, thriving on hate
Dm                                 E
I’ll tell you it was “all for you.” 
Am                           F               
Okiki nasai Honto no bara wa jibun no toge ni
  C    G#dim\D  G         C
Kizutsuitari shinai mono yo

Ya know,
Am
I want you to care that I want you to stay
So I swear I won’t blame you if you turn away
F
At the end of the day, I will smile and give in
To this burning and vile original sin
Am
Cuz hell is the realization your selfish
And drawn to the loving, the soft and the helpless
F
I can see through that facade that you wear
When your honest, and promise you’ll fight the despair
Am
And I ‘ll say it again, that I know I’ m the worst
                                                          F        
So then how can you spend so much love on the person that hurts you like I do?

Cuz inside, I can’t hide that I cannot desert you
(Dm Em F)
And if I’m”the world”to you, surely you
Never stood even a chance at all, didn’t you?
G                 
It’s me, after all.

Am
(whispers)

              F    
I’ll give you fire.
  G         C
Kokoro ni kau
    Am           F
Hello? garou garou
  G       C  Am
Unari kakeru   
F    G       C     Am         F   G       Am
Mata ijiwaru na tsume wo tatete katte ageru 

F  E     (Am B7sus4 C)
raihou yoi no haoto   
 A7      Dm       B         E  
Urezanka tsuibamu karasu ka na
Am    G   C     C\C#
Don’t be afraid.    
      Dm          E
Ii ko ne mou onemuri

              F
I’ll give you fire.
     G              C    
Just keep it to yourself.
   Am             F   
Hello, the hungry wolf
    G                C    Am
Has come to give you hell   
F     G                    C   
Once again I’ll treat you nice,
      Am               F   
Think twice before you fall
    G               Am 
And smile while you do.

Love, the me that’s killing you.

Am | F | Am | F | 2x

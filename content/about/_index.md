### About

![bold and brash](/res/img/pfp-web.png) <br />
Hi, I'm **Simpelplant**, also known as **Seledri**. But goes with **dissonantplant** for my Youtube channel. While I do make guitar videos, something that I regularly do is *drawing cute anime girls*. Guitar is just a sweet hobby at this moment.

I'm Indonesian, yes. I use English here because I expect people from any country to come here. (Also, adding a multi-language or translation feature to the web is arduous. Not gonna do that).

Please leave a comment on any of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMQaD4_LvHag4IHHnP9qxiQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> videos if you have any questions or requests. You can also contact me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/simpelplant" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I can understand both Indonesian and English, so please use either of those languages. (Machine translation is perfectly fine; I won't judge you.)

### About Chords

The chords here may not be 100% accurate, and neither is the rhythm. So don't worry too much if you can't replicate the exact play. If it's too difficult or doesn't fit your ears, you can adjust it to your liking.
